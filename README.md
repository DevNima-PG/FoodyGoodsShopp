A Responsive Web Design With Html &amp; CSS (No Js for menu item) Just for practicing :) 

# Why SCSS?
It was the best choice to do nested CSS and it can Save lots of time, also its really easy because you can write related styles inside each other :) So I tried SCSS this time and
yeah! Thats Perfect.
